FAQ: Updating a Previously Merged Feature

Q: I already created a feature branch (e.g., feature/footer) and it was merged into dev. and may be full requested is merge Now, after some time, I want to make additional changes to that feature. What should I do?

A: You should create a new branch instead of reusing the old one. Here's how:

ðŸ”¹ Step-by-Step Guide

1. Pull the Latest Changes from dev

Make sure your local dev branch is up to date: 

git checkout dev
git pull origin dev

2. Create a New Feature Branch

Use a descriptive name for the new update:

git checkout -b feature/footer-update // for example you make update on footer after 3 week

3. Make Your Changes

Update the component or logic as required.

4. Commit and Push Your Changes

git add .
git commit -m "feat: improved footer design"
git push origin feature/footer-update

5. Create a Pull Request

Open a new pull request from feature/footer-update into dev. The team 
will review and merge it again.

ðŸŒŸ Why Not Reuse the Old Branch?

The old branch is already merged and likely deleted from remote.

Creating a new branch keeps Git history clean.

It avoids confusion and potential merge conflicts.





This approach ensures a clean, organized workflow and smooth collaboration within the team.

You can always repeat this process for any feature you wish to improve or update later.
